/**
 * \class LXMapScaleView
 * \brief Map scale UI element for the built-in iOS MKMapView.
 *
 * As of iOS 5, the built-in MKMapView doesn't support showing a map scale which could
 * come handy if one's interested in the magnitude of distances on the map at the current
 * zoom level. LXMapScaleView is an extension to MKMapView to accomplish this task.
 *
 * The view basically draws a ruler with labels in the appropriate units. The scale is
 * based on that returned by MKMapView for the center point latitude. You should manually
 * update the view each time the map view region changes (the mapView:regionDidChangeAnimated:
 * delegate method is your friend).
 *
 * You can have at most one scale view installed per map view.
 *
 * Needless to say, you must link your project with the MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks.
 *
 * Note: Owing to the characteristics of the Mercator projection used by the map view,
 * the scale view may show different values at different latitudes without changing the
 * zoom level. This is not a bug. :)
